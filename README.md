slickgrid-spreadsheet-plugins
=============================

These plugins aim to add additional spreadsheet type functionality to SlickGrid.

Filter (ext.headerfilter.js)
------

This adds a filter to the column header, displaying an ordered list of the values that can be selected or un-selected to filter.

The plugin relies on the grid data being sourced from a DataView as it handles the filtering.

Options:
* sortAvailable (default: true). Set to false to remove the ability to sort columns via the plugin.
* Column option: unfiltered (If set to true, that column will not have a header filter available).

Overlays (ext.overlays.js)
--------

This plugin creates additional overlays/adorners for the grid.

- Rows and Grids are hilighted based on the selected cell
- The selected cell has a full border around it, including a handle to enable a Fill Down type functionality

For examples of the both plugins see:
